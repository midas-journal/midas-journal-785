\section{Introduction}

The MPI libraries have been installed in the Insight 
Journal testing environment. This paper is here only to 
test if Insight Journal papers that use MPI will compile.

The code accompanying this paper uses ITK and MPI to read 
an image in pieces, send the pieces to the first MPI 
process, and write the pieces from the first MPI process.


% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:
